# Clash of Code


This repository contains my solutions to different code clashes. To be updated periodically.

**sudoku**--used HashMap in determining missing numbers   
**distance**--used HashMap to store item and distance, and also stored distance in ArrayList, which was then sorted, and looped through to get value from HashMap  
**alpha_out_of_order**--return the letter that is out of alphabetical order  
**reverse_entwined**--reverse a string and merge with original string
